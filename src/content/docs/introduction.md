This project addresses lags in the Stripe API documentation.
While the Stripe documentation is great, its user experience still lacks the following:.

- Each response attributes from the API isn't described. Only a `json` output is shown.
  This is bad because a user only understands details of each request argument and have no
  detailed idea to the meaning of each response.
- It only includes parameter arguments and no headers. I believe this is specific to their API.

## Real-Time Finance Data API
I will be using the [Real-Time Finance Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-finance-data) to show a sample of the API documentation. This API provides data from stocks, currency, etc. 
The API sources its data from [Google Finance](https://finance.google.com)
and other additional sources.
