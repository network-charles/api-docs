This project addresses lags in the Stripe API documentation.
While the Stripe documentation is great, its user experience still lacks the following:.

- Each response attributes from the API isn't described. Only a `json` output is shown.
  This is bad because a user only understands details of each request argument and have no
  detailed idea to the meaning of each response.
- It only includes parameter arguments and no headers. I believe this is specific to their API.

## Finance Data API

I will be using a locally hosteed API that was inspired from the the [Real-Time Finance Data API](https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/real-time-finance-data). Note, the Real-Time Finance Data API isn't as detailed as this documentation. This API provides data from stocks, currency, etc.
