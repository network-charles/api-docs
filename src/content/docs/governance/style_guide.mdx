## Language

American and British english are supported.

> I am submitting this project for job applications, so I need to be inclusive.

## Lists

When writing an ordered or un-ordered list, begin each word with an uppercase.

## Tone of words

- Be gender inclusive, replace "he", or "she", with "user".
- Using technology can be frustrating especially for new users,
  avoid using words like "simply", "very easy", etc. Instead of saying,
  "Querying this API is very easy, it requires one call", say "Querying this API requires one call"

## Grammar check

You can use a grammer checker like [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) to verify your grammar when contributing.
