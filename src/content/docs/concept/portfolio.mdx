A financial portfolio contains various asset types,
including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, treasury bills, and other financial instruments.

## Why Have a Financial Portfolio?

- **Risk Management**: When you put all your eggs in one basket. If that basket falls, you
  lose everything. By diversifying your investments across different assets (like stocks,
  bonds, or real estate), your portfolio can stand the ups and downs of the market.
  This is called diversification, and it helps reduce risk.
- **Achieving Goals**: Whether you're saving for retirement, buying a house,
  or building wealth, a portfolio helps you meet these goals by organizing
  your investments in a way that fits your needs.

## Portfolio Types

- **Equity Portfolio**: A portfolio that primarily invests in stocks and other equity-related instruments.
- **Bond Portfolio**: A portfolio focused on bonds and other fixed-income securities.
- **Balanced Portfolio**: A mix of stocks, bonds, and sometimes other asset classes, designed to achieve a balance between risk and return.

In summary, a financial portfolio is a critical tool in
managing an individual's or institution's financial investments.
